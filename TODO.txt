## TODO

- Track kills? heh
- Try to catch some programs mutating within same organism, after trigger?
- watch out for possible Eo moving over food and not eating?
- perhaps exponential decay is not the best choice for healing?  or maybe it is,
	because it implies that if you have more energy, you need to give more of it
	up to heal.  actually that makes no sense. shut up.
    Actually, it's probably a good idea because it gives low-energy creatures
    a second chance, as well as normalizing abnormally high energy creatures
- move all physics/collision handling into Chipmunk
- watch out for possible bug with shooting spikes/packets in the wrong direction?
- generalize shooting spikes/packets into a generic "load buffer" "shoot buffer", to
    make it more like emergent behavior
    - actually, should go on a spree to generalize more of the program functions;
      it's a bit too arbitrary right now.  hm...actually most of them aren't.
- create environment to actually test out everything is working properly, especially
    movement_angle
