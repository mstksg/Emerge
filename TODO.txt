## TODO

- Add detection for feeler-to-feeler collisions? (probably not)
- Also, what the heck at long streams of food packets?
	- Probably to be resolved with new compiler
	- Resolved, but still happening...perhaps packets are triggering their
		own release?
	  Confirmed: streams are due to packets triggering their feelers.
	  	Really, this is inevitable; peraps this can just serve to select against
	  	emitters emitting in the wrong direction?  Perhaps tweak settings to disallow
	  	it in the first place.  Okay, done.
- Write new tier-based compiler
- New, more urgent (for higher-energy) reproduction decision algorithm, to prevent
	huge energy overload ruining the game
	Possibility: Parabola, at (15,0), (20,1/150), (200,1)
	or rather, 707/26137500 x^2 - 2141/5227500 x - 1/17425
	- Temporarily implemented as an energy cap
- Track kills? heh
- Use parent tracking to find closest relatives. Wait, er...maybe this is dangerous,
	because of memory leakage/garbage collection.  Should do this at end, then
- Try to catch some programs mutating within one organism, after trigger?
- watch out for possible Eo moving over food and not eating?
- mutation "limit", for length of DNA program string (maybe?)
