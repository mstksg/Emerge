## TODO

- Try to catch some programs mutating within same organism, after trigger?
- watch out for possible Eo moving over food and not eating?
- perhaps exponential decay is not the best choice for healing?  or maybe it is,
	because it implies that if you have more energy, you need to give more of it
	up to heal.  actually that makes no sense. shut up.
    Actually, it's probably a good idea because it gives low-energy creatures
    a second chance, as well as normalizing abnormally high energy creatures
    Possible side effect: injection of 75-100 energy is reduced to almost nothing
    to heal a damaged Eo. desired?  But injection should not be typical.
- move all physics/collision handling into Chipmunk
- generalize shooting spikes/packets into a generic "load buffer" "shoot buffer", to
    make it more like emergent behavior
    - actually, should go on a spree to generalize more of the program functions;
      it's a bit too arbitrary right now.  hm...actually most of them aren't.
- create environment to actually test out everything is working properly
- possible conservation of energy mechanism?
- allow "sticking"/hooking?
- experiment with solid walls
- "random drifting" gets too much food compared to detectors =(  Or well, not moreso, but
    rather, one needs only to randomly drift before one can get enough to reproduce.  oh well.
    solution would be to raise energy drag
- ** save states **
- eo highlighting (cross-hairs?)
