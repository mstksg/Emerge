## TODO

- Add detection for feeler-to-feeler collisions? (probably not)
- Also, what the heck at long streams of food packets?
	- Probably to be resolved with new compiler
- Write new tier-based compiler
- New, more urgent (for higher-energy) reproduction decision algorithm, to prevent
	huge energy overload ruining the game
	Possibility: Parabola, at (15,0), (20,1/150), (200,1)
	or rather, 707/26137500 x^2 - 2141/5227500 x - 1/17425
