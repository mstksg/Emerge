## TODO

- Track kills? heh
- Try to catch some programs mutating within same organism, after trigger?
- watch out for possible Eo moving over food and not eating?
- perhaps exponential decay is not the best choice for healing?  or maybe it is,
	because it implies that if you have more energy, you need to give more of it
	up to heal.  actually that makes no sense. shut up.
