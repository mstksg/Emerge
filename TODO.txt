## TODO

- Add detection for feeler-to-feeler collisions? (probably not)
- Okay, wtf at eos not catching food packets. perhaps make packets push collisions
	- I think I fixed this; not checking packets if there is only one packet on the pond
- Also, what the heck at long streams of food packets?
	- Probably to be resolved with new compiler
- Write new tier-based compiler
- New, more urgent (for higher-energy) reproduction decision algorithm
