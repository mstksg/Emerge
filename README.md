# Description #

**Emerge** is a project exploring emergent behavior in an environment governed by natural selection and competition.

Organisms float around in a primordial pool, and their characteristics are determined by an internal gene, which mutates
with every succesful (asexual) reproduction cycle.  However, the interesting part is that not only does the mutatable gene
account for their physical characteristics, but also their internal programming.

What we have are not merely survival of the strongest or fastest, but of the smartest.  Indeed, it is my hope that the only
true determination of survival would be intelligence; their physical characteristics should merely be the specialization of
intelligences.

# The Brain #

Every organism (called an "Eo") has one input trigger (a feeler, poking from their body, of varying length).  Input this trigger
are sent into their brain for processing.

The logic in each Eo's brain is randomly generated, and the genetic data encoding it is mutatable.

Sure, I could write the AI for an Eo that would survive the best; but why not let natural selection work its course to stumble on
it over multiple generations?
