# Description #

**Emerge** is a project exploring emergent behavior in an environment governed by
natural selection and competition.

Organisms float around in a primordial pool, and their characteristics are
determined by an internal gene, which mutates with every succesful (asexual)
reproduction cycle.  However, the interesting part is that not only does the mutatable
gene account for their physical characteristics, but also their internal programming.

What we have are not merely survival of the strongest or fastest, but of the smartest.
Indeed, it is my hope that the only true determination of survival would be
intelligence; their physical characteristics should merely be the specialization of
intelligences.

# The "Eo" #

The basic organism is known as the **Eo**, which comes from "(Hopefully) Emergent Organism".
Eos float around more or less aimlessly around the toroidal pool.  Food is sprinkled
randomly around the pool; Eos need this food to survive.  Their energy drains as they move.

When an Eo reaches a certain energy threshold, it may spontaneously reproduce into two
slightly mutated versions of itself.

## Feelers ##

Every Eo has one input trigger: a **feeler**, poking from their body, of varying length
and thickness (determined by DNA).  When an Eo's feeler pokes into another, it damages the
target; eventually, the target may die, and the attacker will gain all of his energy.

When this feeler is triggered, either by food or another Eo, a signal is sent to the brain
for processing.

## The Brain ##

The logic in each Eo's brain is randomly generated, and the genetic data encoding it is mutatable.
That is, when an Eo is created, the program is just a random string of commands (including a basic
"if-then" control structure).  Every time an Eo reproduces, this program might be randomly mutated,
by adding or removing or changing commands.

Sure, I could write the AI for an Eo that would survive the best; but why not let natural selection
work its course to stumble on it over multiple generations?  What if the "smartest" program possible
can be found...by natural selection alone?
